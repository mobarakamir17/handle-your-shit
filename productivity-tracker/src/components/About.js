    This web app is a replica of a Pomodoro App. Pomodoro app are found to be effective when you need to focus to be able to do a certain task folllowed by a quick break. It's effective because it lets your brain rest and you are able to focus better because of the breaks.
    <br />
    <br />
    This app allows you to pick which mode that you would like to study in. There is easy mode, Normal mode, and Hard mode. The modes get harder because the work time gets longer and break time only increase by a little. 


    This is a example of a simple Pomodora App, I hope you enjoy and get working!
